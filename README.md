Hello! My name is Zachary.

## A bit about me!

I'm a web developer and graduate of Michigan State's Full Stack Web Development Cohort.

I'm familiar with both front-end and back-end technologies but I have a deep interest in Data Structures and push myself to learn more everyday.

Building things and fixing things has been a passion since my early teens (before then i didn't fix anything!).
From building computers to fixing old gameboys and attempting to learn C# and Unity as a kid (Ouch!)
I am also a seasoned Video/SFX editor with experience in the Adobe Creative Suite (primarily Premiere, After Effects, Illustrator and Photoshop)
As well as some Blender work on physics based animation.
