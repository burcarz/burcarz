                My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, 
                and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! 
                I was part of something special. Must go faster. Must go faster. 
                You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. 
                God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

                Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Is this my espresso machine? 
                Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Forget the fat lady! 
                You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! 
                We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, 
                and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, 
                they won't want it anymore!

                Did he just throw my cat out of the window? 
                What do they got in there? King Kong? Eventually, 
                you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? 
                Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? I gave it a cold? 
                I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
